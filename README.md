## Development

To run the application locally, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your machine. Once you have the prerequisites installed, follow the steps below to set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TigerAppsOrg/TigerRetail-2
cd TigerRetail-2
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following environment variables. The `SESSION_SECRET` can be any 32-character string:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://root:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/local"
SESSION_SECRET=12345678901234567890123456789012
```

4. Start the local database and development server. Docker must be running on your machine for this to work (since it spins up a PostgreSQL container):

```bash
bun run db:start
bun run db:migrate
bun run dev
```

You can use `bun run db:studio` to open a GUI for the database. Format the code with `bun run format`, lint with `bun run lint`, and run tests with `bun run test`.
